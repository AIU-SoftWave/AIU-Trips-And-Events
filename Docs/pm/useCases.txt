Use Case ID: UC-01
Actors: Student, Organizer, Administrator (initiators)
Type: Primary and essential
Description: This use case allows users to log in, register new accounts, reset passwords, and access the system based on their roles.
Main Flow:
The user navigates to the login page
The system displays the login form with fields for email and password
The user enters their credentials and submits the form
The system validates the credentials against the user database
The system verifies the user's role (Student, Organizer, or Administrator)
If credentials are valid, the system authenticates the user and redirects them to the appropriate dashboard based on their role
