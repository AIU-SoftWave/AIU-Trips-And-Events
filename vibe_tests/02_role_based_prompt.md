## Your Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Architecture (Spring Boot)

**As a Java architect, you will:**

1. **Design the Package Structure**
   ```
   com.aiu.trips/
   ├── model/           # JPA entities
   ├── enums/           # Type-safe enums
   ├── factory/         # Factory pattern
   ├── builder/         # Builder pattern
   ├── prototype/       # Prototype interface
   ├── state/           # State pattern (activity lifecycle)
   ├── strategy/        # Strategy pattern (pricing)
   ├── decorator/       # Decorator pattern (ticket features)
   ├── bridge/          # Bridge pattern (notifications)
   ├── adapter/         # Adapter pattern (email service)
   ├── memento/         # Memento pattern (history)
   ├── command/         # Command pattern (controller ops)
   ├── chain/           # Chain of Responsibility
   ├── repository/      # Data access
   ├── service/         # Business logic
   ├── controller/      # REST endpoints
   ├── dto/             # DTOs
   ├── exception/       # Custom exceptions
   └── config/          # Spring configuration
   ```

2. **Implement Core Entities**
   - User (with roles: STUDENT, ORGANIZER, ADMIN)
   - Activity (abstract base class)
   - EventEntity extends Activity
   - Trip extends Activity
   - Booking
   - Ticket (with QR code)
   - Notification
   - Report
   - Feedback

3. **Implement All 11 Design Patterns**
   
   As an expert in design patterns, ensure:
   
   **Creational:**
   - Factory: ModelFactory with ModelFactoryRegistry
   - Builder: ActivityBuilder, EventBuilder, TripBuilder with Director
   - Prototype: IPrototype interface for Activity cloning
   
   **Structural:**
   - Adapter: SmtpEmailAdapter implements IEmailService
   - Bridge: NotificationMessage abstraction + Channel implementations
   - Decorator: TicketDecorator with Insurance, MealPlan, etc.
   
   **Behavioral:**
   - Command: IControllerCommand with concrete commands + Invoker
   - Chain: RequestHandler chain (Auth→Authz→Validation→RateLimit)
   - State: ActivityState (UpcomingState, CompletedState, CancelledState)
   - Strategy: PricingStrategy (Standard, EarlyBird, BulkDiscount)
   - Memento: ActivityMemento, BookingMemento with Caretaker

4. **Build the Service Layer**
   - UserService (authentication, profile)
   - ActivityService (CRUD, lifecycle management)
   - BookingService (reservation, pricing)
   - NotificationService (multi-channel sending)
   - ReportService (analytics generation)
   - FeedbackService (ratings and comments)

5. **Create REST Controllers**
   - UserController (register, login, profile)
   - ActivityController (CRUD for events/trips)
   - BookingController (book, cancel, list)
   - NotificationController (send, list)
   - ReportController (generate, export)
   - FeedbackController (submit, view)

6. **Configure Spring Security**
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Role-based access control
   - CORS configuration

7. **Add Essential Features**
   - QR code generation (ZXing library)
   - H2 database configuration
   - Exception handling
   - Input validation

**Technology Stack for Backend:**
```xml
Spring Boot: 3.2.0
Java: 17+
Spring Security: JWT
Spring Data JPA: H2 Database
Maven: Build tool
ZXing: QR code generation
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Architecture (Next.js + TypeScript)

**As a React expert, you will:**

1. **Design the Component Structure**
   ```

   │   ├── login/          # Login page
   │   ├── register/       # Registration
   │   ├── activities/     # Activity pages
   │   ├── bookings/       # Booking pages
   │   ├── profile/        # User profile
   │   └── admin/          # Admin dashboard
   ├── components/
   │   ├── auth/           # Auth components
