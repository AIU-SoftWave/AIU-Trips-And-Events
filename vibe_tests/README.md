## 🎯 Purpose

These prompts are designed to help AI systems generate a complete, production-ready university event and trip management system from architectural diagrams. Each prompt uses a different prompting strategy to achieve the same goal.

## 📚 Prompt Files Overview

💻 Frontend Architecture: [structure]
📋 Implementation Checklist: [tasks]
...
```
